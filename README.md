We are working on a mobile app that utilizes IBM Watson's Natural Language Processor to help users better track their mental health.

Users will be encouraged to share their daily thoughts by simply speaking into the app. After the app analyzes the recording, the user will then be presented with a visual representation of their mental and emotional insight.

Users will also be able to add their social media account to see if their social media presense is being viewed positively or negatively by others.

By helping user's understand their mental outputs both privately and publicly, users will be able to have better awareness about how their thoughts impact their mental health.
