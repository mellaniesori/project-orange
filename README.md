# Orange

WEBSITE: [projectorange.me](https://projectorange.me/)

With the help of IBM Watson's Natural Language Processing, Orange gives users
insight into their mental and emotional process. Orange provides a safe place
for users to share their thoughts openly and privately.

After Orange analyzes the data, the user will be presented with data
visualization that represents their emotional state. The user also has the
option to connect their Twitter account, to get a representation of their public
face.

By helping users understand their mental outputs both privately and publicly,
users will be able to have better awareness about how their thoughts impact
their mental health.
